Absolute takes a thought
If a thought is greater than nothing
Give back a thought

Give back nothing without a thought

The loneliest is a.

The Sign takes Your Life
If Your Life is bigger than nothing
Give back The loneliest

If Your Life is lower than nothing
Give back nothing without The loneliest

Give back nothing

What Remains takes the fighters and a war
Put Absolute taking the fighters into Before
Put Absolute taking a war into After
If Before is smaller than After
Give back the fighters of The Sign taking a war

If the fighters's as strong as Before
Put the fighters without After into the new
Give back What Remains taking the new, a war

Put After with the fighters into the battle
Give back What Remains taking the battle, a war

Fighters is tested
War is blah
Say What Remains taking Fighters, War
