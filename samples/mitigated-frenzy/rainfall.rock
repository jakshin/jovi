My hopes are nothing
The future is nothing without my hopes
 
Listen to the sky
Until the sky is decimated, destroyed; sparkling, sinuously perfected
Build my hopes up
My dreams are the sky with the future
They are my dreams
Listen to the sky
 
If my hopes ain't nothing
shout the future over my hopes
 
If my hopes are nothing
whisper the future of my hopes
