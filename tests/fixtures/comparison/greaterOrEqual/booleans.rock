(Using the greater-than-or-equal comparison operator on booleans)

Rightness is right
Wrongness is wrong

Say "booleans aren't greater than or equal to other booleans" (which is a bit weird because they obviously *can* be equal, but it's per spec...)
Rightness is right
Wrongness is wrong
say Rightness is as great as Rightness
say Wrongness is as great as Wrongness
say Rightness is as great as Wrongness
say Wrongness is as great as Rightness
say true is as great as true
say false is as great as false
say true is as great as false
say false is as great as true

(We test booleans against numbers and strings in numbers.rock and strings.rock)
