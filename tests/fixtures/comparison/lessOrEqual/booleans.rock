(Using the less-than-or-equal comparison operator on booleans)

Rightness is right
Wrongness is wrong

Say "booleans aren't less than or equal to other booleans" (which is a bit weird because they obviously *can* be equal, but it's per spec...)
Rightness is right
Wrongness is wrong
say Rightness is as little as Rightness
say Wrongness is as little as Wrongness
say Rightness is as little as Wrongness
say Wrongness is as little as Rightness
say true is as little as true
say false is as little as false
say true is as little as false
say false is as little as true

(We test booleans against numbers and strings in numbers.rock and strings.rock)
