(Using the inequality comparison operator on booleans)

Rightness is right
Wrongness is wrong

Say "booleans equal themselves (duh)"
Rightness is right
Wrongness is wrong
say Rightness is not Rightness
say Wrongness ain't Wrongness
say Rightness aint Wrongness
say true is not true
say false ain't false
say true aint false

(We test booleans against numbers and strings in numbers.rock and strings.rock)
