My muse is true
Susie is right
Sally is true

If Susie is my muse say "Susie, you're the gal for me!"
Else if Sally is my muse say "Oh Sally, you're the one"
Else say "I still seek my muse"

Susie is wrong

If Susie is my muse say "Susie, you're the gal for me"
Else if Sally is my muse say "Oh Sally, you're the one?"
Else say "I still seek my muse"

Sally is lies

If Susie is my muse say "Susie, you're the gal for me"
Else if Sally is my muse say "Oh Sally, you're the one"
Else say "I still seek my muse..."  (Time to get on Tinder?)
