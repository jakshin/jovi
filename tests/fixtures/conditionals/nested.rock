The rightness is right
Looking Good is hard to do
Put the rightness into it
The one is amazing

Jenny is ok
Linda is ok (too)
Johnny is a nice guy
Lyle is cockier

Your friend is lonely
The start is blah news
The end is even rougher

While the start ain't the end
  If Jenny is Looking Good
    Knock Jenny down
    If Johnny is right say "Johnny & Jenny are in love!"
    Else if Lyle is the one say "Lyle & Jenny are in love"
    Else say "Jenny's alone, no man is right for her"

  Else if Linda is Looking Good
    Put lies into Linda
    If Johnny is right say "Johnny & Linda are in love"
    Else if Lyle is the one say "Lyle & Linda are in love!"
    Else say "Linda's alone, no man is right for her"

  Else
    If Johnny is right say "Johnny's all alone, poor fella"
    Else if Lyle is the one say "Lyle is by himself, so sad"
    Else say "Ain't nobody in love after all, I guess..."
    Say "That's just how it goes some days."

  (the blank line just above closes "Else say ...", we need another to close the bare "else" further above)
  If Johnny is stronger than nobody he is nowhere, That is true
  Say "But wait, Johnny changed his mind?"

  If That is wrong and Lyle ain't your friend, knock Lyle down
  Say "Oh, Lyle has moved away?"

  That is nothing
  Build the start up
