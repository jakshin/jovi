The whole is 2
Your heart is 3
Put the whole of your heart into my hands (multiply your heart by the whole and assign the result to my hands)
Say my hands (6)

Your love is all I live for
My world is nothing without your love (initialize my world with the result of subtracting your love from 0)
Say your love (-3143)

The tears are spilling
A child is crying
If the tears of a child is nothing (check whether the tears * a child = 0)
Say "whoops" (shouldn't run this line, because 48 != 0)

My heart is pounding tonight
The moon is so big and bright
Say my heart over the moon (87 / 2336 = 0.03724315068493151)
