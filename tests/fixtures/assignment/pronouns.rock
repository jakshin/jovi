(You can use a pronoun after "put")

Your mouth is always open
A sock is a good way to fix that that kind of problem
Put it into your mouth
Say your mouth

(You can also use a pronoun after "into"... but it's usually only useful for assigning literals,
because if you mention any variable between "put" and "into", the pronoun binds to that variable,
not the noun you'd expect from normal English usage)

Your mouth is still open
Put 1 into it
Say your mouth
