Say "multiplication works on numeric variables"
Int is 42
Float is 12.34
say Int times Float (518.28)
say Float times Int (518.28)

Say "multiplication works with null, treating null as zero"
Nada is nothing
say Nada times Int (0)
say Float times nothing (0)

Say "multiplying a string repeats it"
Str is "foo"
say Str times 3
say Str times 0 (empty string)
say nothing times "bar"
say 3.5 times "baz" (3.5 gets truncated to 3)
